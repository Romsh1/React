###### PROPS
-> It's a way to pass data from parent to child component
-> Makes components reusable and dynamic 
FEATURES:
1. READ-ONLY - Props are immutable. A child component cannot modify its props
2. Props follow a unidirectional data flow i.e. from parent to child
3. Is dynamic in case of data types


############ STATE
********************** props vs state *********************
-> props get passed to the component        state is managed within the component
-> Function params                          Variables declared in the function body
-> props are immutable                      state can be changed
-> can be accessed by using
    props in Functional components          useState Hook in Functional components
    this.props in Class components          this.state in Class components
